## Implementation Notes

### Admin Commands Philosophy

Admin commands follow the tier of their parent feature:
- Economy admin commands → Free (Economy is free)
- Valorant admin commands → Free (Valorant stats are free)
- Bounty admin commands → Free (Bounties are free)
- Mafia admin commands → Plus (Mafia is Plus)

### Tier Check Integration

When implementing subscription checks in command handlers:

```javascript
const { checkSubscription } = require("../utils/subscriptionUtils");

// Example: Plus-tier command
if (!(await checkSubscription(userId, "plus"))) {
  return message.reply("This feature requires a Plus subscription! Upgrade at https://your-site.com");
}
```

### Tier Hierarchy

- `free` < `plus` < `ultimate`
- Higher tiers include all features from lower tiers
- Server owners with Ultimate unlock features for their entire server

### Upgrade Prompts

When free users attempt Plus/Ultimate features, show friendly upgrade prompts with feature benefits rather than error messages.

**Example:**
```
❌ This feature requires Bobby Plus!

🎮 **Bobby Plus** includes:
• Blackjack & all PvP games
• Bee Mafia social deduction
• Bobby AI with memory
• Valorant team builder
• And more!

Upgrade for just $4.99/month at https://your-site.com
```
